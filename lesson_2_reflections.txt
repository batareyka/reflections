What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    When you initialize a repository, it becomes able to store metadata needed 
    for GIT's work. It is needed because you don't want Git to track every single 
    repository on your computer, so you need to tell it which ones to track.
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    
    Staging area is temporary space when files that are going to be committed
    together are stored. Working directory and repository store files permanently.
    Staging area offers flexibility - you can choose how many files and changes are 
    going to be grouped in one commit in the repository.
    
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
