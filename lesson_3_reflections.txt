When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When many people work on the same project or when you work on a project from several 
  devices and want to have access to the latest version of your work from any place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
  To make sure changes that are not ready to be public yet don't become public. To make sure 
  you share the right branch and not your experimental code.
